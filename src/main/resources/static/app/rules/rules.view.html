        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <h4>
            You are more than welcome to join in, but before you do, please take few minutes to read the rules:
        </h4>

        <br><ins>Distribution of spoils:</ins><br><br>

        Your main goal is to gain as many points as possible<br>
        At the end of the tournament, top 3 users will win the pot<br>
        First place - 50% of the pot<br>
        Second place - 30% of the pot<br>
        Third place - 20% of the pot<br>
        pot size depends on how many users will join in<br><br>

        And what if more than one user is in the first 3 places?<br>
        1. 2 users share the the highest score<br>
        They will split 80% (1st and 2nd prizes) of the pot between them<br>
        The second best score (1 or more users) will split the rest of the pot between them<br>
        The third best score will not win any prize in this case.<br>
        2. 3 or more users share the highest score - they split 100% of the pot between them<br>
        The second and third best doesn't win anything.<br>
        3. One user has the highest score, 2 or more users share the second highest score<br>
        The first place will take 50% of the pot<br>
        The users in the second place will split 50% (2nd and 3rd prizes) of the pot between them<br>
        Third best score doesn't win anything<br>

        <br><br><ins>Points calculation method:</ins><br><br>

        Match Points (can be updated during the tournament, each match until it's kickoff time)<br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Correct match result (1X2) worth 1 point</b></li>
            <li><b>Guessing exact match score worth another 2 points</b></li>
            <li><b>result is determined after 90 minutes, not including extra time/penalties</b></li>
        </ul>

        e.g: United States vs Wales<br>
        You guessed United States wins 3-1<br>
        If Wales wins or the match ends up with a draw - you get no points<br>
        If United States wins in every score except 3-1 - you get 1 point<br>
        If United States wins exactly 3-1 - you get 3 points<br><br>

        This is relevant to all tournament matches (from group stage till the final)<br><br>

        Bet on knockout matches can be done only once the match teams are known<br>
        Make sure you place your bet before knockout matches, you don't want to lose points because of that<br>
        Betting on knockout matches is done regardless to the teams chosen by you as qualifiers<br><br>

        <br><br><ins>Qualifier Bets:</ins><br><br>

        <b>Qualifier Points can be changed until the tournament starts</b><br>
        For every correct qualifier you get:
        <b>
            <ul>
                <li>Round of 16 - 2 point</li>
                <li>Quarter final - 4 points</li>
                <li>Semi-final - 6 points</li>
                <li>Final - 8 points</li>
                <li>Third Place - 10 points</li>
                <li>Winner - 12 points</li>
            </ul>
        </b>
